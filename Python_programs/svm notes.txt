SVM- Support Vector machine
It helps to find optimal hyperplane that separates the daatpoints of different class
in high dimensional space
Classification- Support vector Classifier
Regression- Support Vecrtor Regressor

Two Types:
Linear SVM- Can Classify dataset into two classes using single straight line

Non -Linear SVM- used for Non Linear Separable data, Dataset cannot be classified or separated 
using single straight line.

Hyperplane
Decision Boundary to segregate dataset in classes in n-dimensional Space

Support Vector
Datapoints which are closest to the decision boundary

Non Linear SVM-

Kernel:
Used to solve non linear problem
1. Linear Kernel
f(x1,x2)=x1.x2

2.Polynomial Kernel
k(x1x2)=(x1.x2+1)^d

3.Gaussian Radial Basis Function
f(xi,xj)=exp(-gamma|xi-Xj|^2)

4.Sigmoid Kernel
